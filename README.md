# ðŸ“Œ Movie Statistic Project : Using Netflix 

As part of this project, I'm tasked with researching the content produced by streaming services, particularly Netflix, over the past few years. I'm gathering information for a report on the types of films being produced, as well as trends worth exploring further. 

## Dataset

I decided to start my research by exploring some data about films and documentaries produced by Netflix. I will use a dataset on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores/data. My dataset included 503 films with the following variables : 

* title: title of the film
* genre: genre of the film
* language: primary language of the film
* year: year the film premiered
* runtime: length of the film in minutes
* score: film rating of 1 to 10 (worst to best) from the website IMDb
