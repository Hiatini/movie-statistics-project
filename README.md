# 📌 Movie Statistic Project : Using Netflix 

As part of this project, I'm tasked with researching the content produced by streaming services, particularly Netflix, over the past few years. I'm gathering information for a report on the types of films being produced, as well as trends worth exploring further. 

## Dataset

I decided to start my research by exploring some data about films and documentaries produced by Netflix. I will use a dataset on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores/data. My dataset included 503 films with the following variables : 

* title: title of the film
* genre: genre of the film
* language: primary language of the film
* year: year the film premiered
* runtime: length of the film in minutes
* score: film rating of 1 to 10 (worst to best) from the website IMDb

## Individual Variables
### Language

First, I decided to start with the language variable. The following table shows the number of films in each language. With this in mind, I'll start by understanding what the different languages of the films are. From the graphs, we can see that we have 4 languages: English, Spanish, Hindi and French. We'll also be interested to see which films are translated into just one language, and which have several languages available for the film.
